With his transforming hextech hammer in hand, Jayce uses his strength, courage, and considerable intelligence to protect his hometown. While revered throughout the city as a hero, he hasn\u2019t taken well to the attention it brings. Still, Jayce\u2019s heart is in the right place, and even those who envy his natural skills are grateful for his protection in the City of Progress.</p><p>A native son of Piltover, Jayce was raised to believe in the principles that made the city great: Invention. Discovery. Not going to Zaun if you could help it. With a knack for understanding machinery, Jayce earned the honor of being the youngest apprenta to ever be offered patronage by Clan Giopara, one of Piltover\u2019s most respected ruling clans. Utterly unsurprised, Jayce took the offer, and spent most of his early years constructing potential hextech devices and designing transformable multi-tools for Piltover\u2019s working class: a wrench that transformed into a prybar, a pickaxe that could morph into a shovel, a hammer that could turn into a demolition beam, if only it had a sufficiently powerful battery. Everything Jayce touched put his contemporaries to shame.</p><p>Most things came easy to Jayce, and he could never understand why his peers had so much trouble with what, to him, were simple concepts. As a result, nearly everyone who worked alongside Jayce found him arrogant, dismissive, and unwilling to slow his pace to help his colleagues catch up. As time went on, his patience became shorter, while at the same time, a chasm grew between decorum, charm, and Jayce\u2019s natural demeanor.</p><p>Only one person ever managed to match Jayce\u2019s intelligence while also maintaining a healthy indifference to his superior attitude.</p><p>His name was Viktor.</p><p>The two met at a mandatory Progress Day party, and immediately bonded over how little either of them wanted to be there. They started working together shortly after. Viktor expanded Jayce\u2019s intellectual horizons and challenged many of his assumptions. While Jayce sought to improve humanity via versatile technology, Viktor sought to solve problems inherent to humanity itself, such as physical decay or illogical prejudices. They constantly argued with one another, but their conflicts never got personal \u2013 though their methods were different, the two colleagues knew their ultimate goals were very much the same. More than that, they both knew what it was like to be ostracized by their colleagues: Viktor because of his unconventional thinking, Jayce because of his rudeness.</p><p>Together, Jayce and Viktor invented a mechanized construction suit for Piltover\u2019s dockworkers \u2013 something hearty enough to enhance the wearer\u2019s strength, but light enough that its wearer wouldn\u2019t immediately drown upon falling overboard. However, the two reached an impasse when Viktor\u2019s design for the next version of the suit included a chemtech implant that would increase the wearer\u2019s strength output by tenfold, while also preventing them from getting tired, panicking, or disobeying instructions from their superiors. While Viktor considered this feature a brilliant means of reducing the frequency of construction accidents, Jayce found its indifference toward free will immoral. The two nearly came to blows over the design and ultimately, after Jayce warned the academy of Viktor\u2019s invention, Viktor was stripped of his honors and ostracized from Piltover\u2019s scientific community. </p><p>Viktor was the closest thing Jayce had ever really had to a friend, and distraught over their falling-out, went back to working on his own. He grew more insular. His patience toward others grew even thinner.</p><p>As Jayce studied in solitude, Clan Giopara\u2019s explorers discovered a raw, blue crystal deep within the Shuriman desert. Though Jayce volunteered to experiment on it (specifically by suggesting the clan\u2019s other scholars wouldn\u2019t be smart enough to get anything out of it), his lack of tact in doing so prompted Clan Giopara to give it to their better-mannered scholars as a form of punishment. Yet, after many months, the scholars reached a unanimous conclusion: the crystal was worthless. A power-drained hunk of rock. The disappointed clan leaders finally handed the crystal over to Jayce, assuming that even he, with his remarkable intelligence, wouldn\u2019t be able to learn anything from it.</p><p>Something inside the crystal called to Jayce. No, more than that \u2013 it sang to him. He couldn\u2019t explain why, but he knew the Shuriman gem still held mysteries yet to be discovered.</p><p>He spent many months running every variety of test on the crystal. He braced it into a cogwheel centrifuge; he superheated it and deep-froze it; he tinkered, and observed, and hypothesized, and beat his head against his copper pantograph. Quite simply, Jayce wasn\u2019t used to working hard: this damned crystal was the first thing that had ever resisted his considerable mental aptitude. For the first time, he realized how his peers must have felt, trying so hard to solve a problem, only to bump against your own limitations. It felt frustrating. It felt unfair. </p><p>And it probably felt much, much worse if you were working alongside an arrogant inventor who dismissed your every effort. </p><p>Jayce realized that despite how dismissive he\u2019d been toward his fellow scholars, none of them ever gave up. None of them ever stopped seeking the very things that defined Piltover: Progress. Discovery. If they wouldn\u2019t give up, Jayce decided, he wouldn\u2019t either. </p><p>And maybe he\u2019d try to be nicer. </p><p>Maybe.</p><p>Jayce approached the problem from a completely different angle. Rather than trying to experiment on the crystal as a whole, he wondered, why not run more invasive experiments on a smaller shard? Jayce chiseled off a piece of the crystal and suspended it in a liquid alloy. As he sent a voltaic current through the liquid metal, Jayce\u2019s eardrums nearly shattered from the booming baritone note that blasted from the shard. Heat radiated from the crystal and, with a flash, it glowed bright enough to nearly blind him. This was unexpected. This was potentially dangerous. But this was progress. Jayce couldn\u2019t erase the smile from his face as he worked well through the night, into the dawn. </p><p>The next day, Jayce was surprised to find his old friend Viktor on his doorstep. Alerted by the massive power spike from the crystal shard, Viktor had a simple proposition.</p><p>Since his expulsion from the Piltovan scientific community, Viktor had commenced work on a secret project in Zaun. He\u2019d finally learned how to achieve his dream \u2013 how to eradicate disease, hunger, hatred. If Jayce joined him, the two would accomplish more than anyone from Piltover or Zaun could have dreamed of: they\u2019d save humanity from itself. </p><p>Jayce had heard a monologue like this before from Viktor. He never liked where it led.</p><p>Viktor told Jayce that he only needed one thing for his Glorious Evolution \u2013 a power source like Jayce\u2019s crystal. Jayce disagreed, informing Viktor that what he truly needed was a moral compass. Viktor, who had long grown tired of Jayce\u2019s rudeness, leapt upon him, grabbed the crystal and knocked Jayce unconscious with it. When Jayce awoke hours later, he noticed that though the Shuriman crystal was gone Viktor hadn\u2019t seemed to notice or care about the smaller shard.</p><p>Jayce knew whatever Viktor was planning, he would only resort to these measures if he were close to completion. Even though he didn\u2019t know what Viktor\u2019s Glorious Evolution consisted of, it probably didn\u2019t have a lot of respect for the free will of others. Without wasting a second, Jayce retrieved the suspended shard and installed it into a massive, transforming hammer \u2013 a demolitions invention he\u2019d abandoned years ago for lack of a strong enough battery to power it. Though he had no idea where Viktor might have taken the crystal, he could feel the hextech hammer vibrate, pulling him not north, south, east or west, but down, toward the undercity of Zaun.</p><p>The shard, eager to be reunited with the crystal from which it was chiseled, eventually led Jayce to a warehouse in the depths of the sump. Within the cavernous building, Jayce found something horrifying. Dozens of corpses, their skulls sawed open and hollowed out, their brains transplanted into an army of immobile metal soldiers, hooked up to the now-pulsing crystal. </p><p>This was the first step in Viktor\u2019s Glorious Evolution.</p><p>Jayce\u2019s stride grew less confident as he approached Viktor. He and Viktor had not always seen eye to eye, but this was something else entirely. For the first time, it occurred to Jayce that he might have to kill his old friend.</p><p>He called out to Viktor, flinching as the army of robots stood to attention. Jayce asked him to look around \u2013 to see what he was doing. Whatever this was \u2013 this Evolution \u2013 wasn\u2019t the progress they fought for in their youths. He even, to Viktor\u2019s surprise, apologized for acting like such a jerk. </p><p>Viktor sighed. He had only two words in response: \u201cKill him.\u201d</p><p>The automatons sprinted toward Jayce, breaking free of the wires connecting them to the crystal and introducing Jayce to another new emotion: panic. He gripped the hammer tight, realizing he\u2019d never actually used it before. When the first golem was within reach, he swung as hard as he could, feeling the shard\u2019s energy surge through his muscles, accelerating the hammer\u2019s movement until Jayce was worried it might fly out of his hands.</p><p>It slammed into the automaton, all but exploding it into a hail of metal. Despite the obliteration of their comrade, the other machines didn\u2019t even pause as they rushed at Jayce, trying to pummel him into unconsciousness.</p><p>Jayce analyzed the formation of the mechanical wave coming at him and attempted to quickly calculate how to take out the largest number of them with the fewest amount of swings. It was pointless; they were on him before he could swing even once. As he fell to the ground under a storm of their blows, Jayce saw Viktor looking on, not with triumph, but with sadness. He\u2019d outsmarted Jayce and ensured humanity\u2019s future, but he knew that future came at a cost: he couldn\u2019t let his old friend live. Jayce vanished under a sea of swinging metal limbs.</p><p>That\u2019s when Jayce, for the first time in his life, decided to stop thinking and just break stuff.</p><p>No longer caring for his own safety, Jayce used every last bit of strength he had to break free from Viktor\u2019s automatons. He sprinted to the glowing crystal, and struck it with all of the hextech-enhanced force his hammer could muster, crushing the mystical object.</p><p>Viktor cried out in horror as the crystal shattered to fragments, the shockwave blasting them all backward as the army of automatons collapsed lifelessly to the floor. The very foundations of the warehouse shook, and Jayce barely managed to escape before the entire building toppled. </p><p>Viktor\u2019s body was never found.</p><p>Upon his return to Piltover, Jayce informed his clan masters of Viktor\u2019s nefarious plans. Soon, Jayce found himself a topic of discussion in both Zaun and Piltover alike. Hailed for his quick thinking in a time of crisis, Jayce became a beloved figure (at least, amongst those who hadn\u2019t met him), earning himself a nickname: the Defender of Tomorrow.</p><p>Jayce cared little for the adoration of his fellow Piltovans, but took the nickname to heart. He knew that Viktor was still out there, plotting his revenge. One day \u2013 maybe someday soon \u2013 an awful lot of trouble was headed for Piltover.</p><p>And Jayce would be waiting. </p>", "short": "Jayce is a brilliant inventor who has pledged his life to the defense of Piltover and its unyielding pursuit of progress.
