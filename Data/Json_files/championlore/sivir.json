With her entire family slain by marauding Kthaons\u2014one of the Great Sai\u2019s most infamous raider tribes\u2014the young girl and other orphans like her could only hope to survive by stealing food from local markets, and delving into half-buried ancient ruins in search of trinkets to sell. They would brave cramped tunnels and forgotten crypts, hunting for anything of value, often scrapping viciously with one another over the best finds.</p><p>Sivir would lead others into the depths, but could rarely hold on to what few treasures she managed to unearth. After being robbed by her supposed friend Mhyra, she swore she would never allow herself to be betrayed again, and in time she joined a group of mercenaries led by the renowned Iha Ziharo, serving as their guide and general lackey.</p><p>Though her flourishing skill at arms eventually led her to become Ziharo\u2019s personal sergeant, Sivir noted that the domineering leader took the greatest share of gold and glory from every raid\u2026 even when it was Sivir\u2019s clever strategies that brought them their wealth. Rallying her fellow sellswords, Sivir decided to strike against Ziharo, and replace her as leader. Unwilling to kill her former mentor, though, Sivir left her alone in the desert with a hollow offer of good luck.</p><p>Over the years, Sivir and her new followers earned a fearsome reputation. They accepted any task for good pay, including a commission from a Nashramae patriarch looking for a lost heirloom\u2014a blade known as \u201cthe Chalicar\u201d. Accompanied by his personal guards, Sivir searched for many months, until she finally pried a cross-shaped blade from the sarcophagus of some hero of the old Shuriman empire.</p><p>This was a treasure indeed, crafted by cunning and magic in a long-forgotten age. Sivir marveled at it\u2014never had a weapon felt so natural in her grip. When the captain of the guard demanded they return it to their master, Sivir threw the blade in a curved arc, decapitating the captain and cutting down the three men behind him in an instant. She fought her way from the tomb, leaving only the dead in her wake.</p><p>Sivir\u2019s reputation soon spread beyond the desert. Indeed, when Noxian expeditions began to move inland from the northern coast, she found herself in the employ of Cassiopeia, the youngest daughter of General Du Couteau, to help plunder Shurima\u2019s lost capital. As they traversed twisting catacombs, many of Sivir\u2019s mercenaries fell to ancient traps, but Cassiopeia refused to turn back.</p><p>When they finally reached a great tomb door, surrounded by statued guardians and bas-reliefs depicting the mighty god-warriors of old, Sivir felt her blood stir. She was mesmerized by these beast-headed heroes, and their wars against the foul creatures of the underworld.</p><p>Taking advantage of Sivir\u2019s inattention, Cassiopeia thrust a dagger into the mercenary\u2019s back.</p><p>Sivir collapsed in agony, her blood soaking the sand. Using the Chalicar itself, Cassiopeia unlocked the tomb door, unknowingly triggering the sorcerous curse that had been placed upon it. On the verge of death, Sivir watched as a stone serpent came to life before her eyes, searing Cassiopeia's skin with venom. The last thing the sellsword heard before her senses dimmed were the roars of maddened gods, unleashed from the tomb to walk the earth once more\u2026</p><p>But fate, it seemed, was not yet done with Sivir.</p><p>Unknown to her, she carried the last trace of an ancient, royal bloodline in her veins. She awoke to find herself tended by none other than Azir\u2014the last ruler of the empire, who had been denied his rite of Ascension and passed into legend. Her spilled blood had reawakened his spirit after almost three thousand years, completing the ritual and imbuing him with all the celestial power of a god-emperor. There, in the Oasis of the Dawn, he used the healing waters of that sacred pool to miraculously <i>undo</i> Sivir\u2019s mortal wound.</p><p>She had heard tales of Azir and his prophesied return, and always thought only fools could believe in such fantasy\u2026 and yet she could not deny what was unfolding before her very eyes.The earth split, and great plumes of dust whirled into the air as the ancient city of Shurima rose from its grave, crowned by an enormous golden disc that shone with the heavenly rays of the sun. Shaken to her very core, Sivir fled with the Chalicar on her back.</p><p>While she would have liked nothing more than to return to her former life, she instead found herself caught up in the struggles of powers greater than most mortals could comprehend. At the city of Vekaura, she crossed paths with another Ascended being\u2014the freed magus Xerath, now seeking to end Azir\u2019s bloodline for good\u2014but with the help of the scholar Nasus and a young stoneweaver named Taliyah, Sivir survived once more.</p><p>The time has now come when she must choose a path, either embracing the destiny she has been given, or forging her own amid the shifting sands of Shurima.</p>", "short": "<p>Sivir is a renowned mercenary captain who plies her trade in the deserts of Shurima. Armed with her legendary jeweled crossblade, she has fought and won countless battles for those who can afford her services, and prides herself on recovering lost treasures from the catacombs beneath the old empire\u2014for a generous share of the profits, of course. With ancient forces stirring the very bones of Shurima, Sivir now finds herself torn between conflicting destinies\u2026</p>", "quote": "\u201cCoin may buy you skill for a day, but never loyalty.\u201d", "quote-author": ""}, "bioImage": null, "headerImage": null}, "related-champions": [{"type": "champion", "release-date": "2014-09-16", "name": "Azir", "slug": "azir", "echelon": 0, "associated-faction": "", "associated-faction-slug": "shurima", "image": {"type": "image", "title": {"en_us": ""}, "subtitle": "", "description": "", "uri": "https://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/img/champion/splash/Azir_0.jpg", "encoding": "image/jpeg", "width": 1215, "height": 717, "x": 1026, "y": 96, "featured-champions": []}, "role": [{"name": "Mage", "slug": "mage"}, {"name": "Marksman", "slug": "marksman"}]}, {"type": "champion", "release-date": "2009-10-01", "name": "Nasus", "slug": "nasus", "echelon": 1, "associated-faction": "", "associated-faction-slug": "shurima", "image": {"type": "image", "title": {"en_us": ""}, "subtitle": "", "description": "", "uri": "https://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/img/champion/splash/Nasus_0.jpg", "encoding": "image/jpeg", "width": 1215, "height": 717, "x": 889, "y": 40, "featured-champions": []}, "role": [{"name": "Fighter", "slug": "fighter"}, {"name": "Tank", "slug": "tank"}]}, {"type": "champion", "release-date": "2016-05-18", "name": "Taliyah", "slug": "taliyah", "echelon": 2, "associated-faction": "", "associated-faction-slug": "shurima", "image": {"type": "image", "title": {"en_us": ""}, "subtitle": "", "description": "", "uri": "https://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/img/champion/splash/Taliyah_0.jpg", "encoding": "image/jpeg", "width": 1215, "height": 717, "x": 1063, "y": 0, "featured-champions": []}, "role": [{"name": "Mage", "slug": "mage"}, {"name": "Support", "slug": "support"}]}], "explore-champions": [], "modules": [{"type": "story-preview", "title": "Water", "subtitle": null, "description": "<p><i>Sivir's throat felt like it was coated in a layer of broken glass.
