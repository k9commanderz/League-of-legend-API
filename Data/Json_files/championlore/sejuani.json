Her mother, the Iceborn warrior Kalkia of the Winter\u2019s Claw, abandoned her new family to pursue the man who had captured her heart years before, and the tribe fell into decline and chaos without a young Warmother to lead it.</p><p>Sejuani was instead raised by her grandmother, Hejian. Though Sejuani tried her best to earn Hejian\u2019s love, she was never able to meet her arduous expectations. As the tribe\u2019s troubles grew in the years that followed, Hejian had even less time for the girl.</p><p>Wealth, love, safety\u2014these were things Sejuani only experienced secondhand, through visits to the Winter\u2019s Claw\u2019s sister tribe, the Avarosans. During the summers, Grena, the most famous warrior in the region, took Sejuani into her household. After discovering Grena had in fact once bested Kalkia in a duel, the Avarosan Warmother instantly became Sejuani\u2019s idol\u2026 and Grena\u2019s daughter Ashe became the only person she ever truly considered a friend.</p><p>After Grena questioned the treatment of the young girl by her grandmother, an affronted Hejian cut all ties with the Avarosans. The Winter\u2019s Claw then instigated a series of conflicts with other neighboring tribes, attempting to reclaim the lands and honor they had lost with Kalkia\u2019s flight, but these desperate tactics only led them further into ruin.</p><p>Somehow, word of this reached Kalkia.</p><p>Hearing of her former tribe\u2019s misfortunes, she returned and took up the mantle of Warmother once more. Even so, quelling these hostilities left the Winter\u2019s Claw with game-poor lands and precious few other resources, forcing them to rely on the grim Frostguard for protection.</p><p>Sejuani was galled by this, and resolved to seize leadership from her mother. She swore a sacred oath to lead a perilous raid against a Noxian warship, hoping that fulfilling this oath would be enough to rally the tribe to her, with enough support to wrest power from Kalkia and the Frost Priests.</p><p>During the vicious assault, Sejuani freed a juvenile dr\u00fcvask from the ship\u2019s butchery stores, naming it Bristle for the feel of its hide. Though she could not have guessed it at the time, this creature would grow to become one of the largest dr\u00fcvasks ever seen, and remained with Sejuani as her loyal steed.</p><p>Her raid a success, Sejuani decided it was time to challenge her mother directly for the tribe. By the ancient customs, a duel between a mother and her daughter was unthinkable\u2014but Sejuani would not be deterred.</p><p>Outraged, the Frost Priests were forced to intervene, and Kalkia died in the struggle before Sejuani could reach her.</p><p>As the new Warmother of the Winter\u2019s Claw, Sejuani began attacking and absorbing nearby tribes, consolidating her power and gathering a veritable horde of followers. Her defiance of the Frostguard also attracted outcast shamans, spirit walkers, Iceborn and Stormborn, and unrepentant worshippers of all the old gods from across the Freljord.</p><p>Where once they had been weak, disgraced, and preyed upon by their neighbors, in only a few years the Winter\u2019s Claw had become feared throughout the northlands for their speed, brutality, and absolute devotion to their Warmother.</p><p>Now, as the seasons turn, Sejuani marches on the southern tribes, Noxian interlopers, and even the borderlands of Demacia\u2014raiding, pillaging, and conquering any who stand against her. Ultimately, she seeks to cast down and destroy the burgeoning coalition of tribes formed by her childhood friend, Ashe. As far as Sejuani is concerned, the Avarosan Warmother has betrayed not only their friendship but, far worse, she has also betrayed Grena\u2019s legacy.</p><p>And so, Sejuani will prove that only <i>she</i> is worthy of ruling the Freljord.</p>", "short": "Sejuani is the brutal, unforgiving Warmother of the Winter\u2019s Claw, one of the most feared tribes of the Freljord. Her people\u2019s survival is a constant, desperate battle against the elements, forcing them to raid Noxians, Demacians, and Avarosans alike to survive the harsh winters. Sejuani herself spearheads the most dangerous of these attacks from the saddle of her dr\u00fcvask boar Bristle, using her True Ice flail to freeze and shatter her enemies.", "quote": "\u201cI was cut from the ice.
