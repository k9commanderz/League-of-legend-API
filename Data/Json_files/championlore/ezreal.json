His parents were renowned archaeologists, so he became used to their long absences from the family home, often fantasizing about joining them on their travels. He loved hearing tales of high adventure, and shared their desire to fill in the blank spaces on every map.</p><p>He was often left in the care of his uncle, the esteemed Professor Lymere. The professor did not enjoy having to wrangle such a rash and unruly child, and assigned the strictest tutors to teach him subjects including advanced cartography, hextech mechanics, and the ancient histories of Runeterra. But the boy had a knack for simply <i>absorbing</i> information, and found studying a waste of time. He passed assessments easily, with little or no preparation, infuriating his uncle and giving himself more time to roam the university grounds. Ezreal took great pleasure in evading the campus wardens, navigating the tunnels beneath the lecture halls as easily as the library rooftops. He even practiced lockpicking, sneaking into his teachers\u2019 offices and rearranging their belongings for his own amusement.</p><p>Whenever Ezreal\u2019s parents returned to Piltover, his father in particular would tell him all they had seen, and their plans for future expeditions\u2014none more ambitious and secretive than the search for the lost tomb of Ne\u2019Zuk, a Shuriman tyrant who was said to be able to jump instantly from one place to another. If Ezreal\u2019s father could learn whatever sorcery Ne\u2019Zuk had possessed, he joked that wherever he was traveling, he would simply drop into Piltover for dinner with his son each night.</p><p>As the boy grew older, the time between his parents\u2019 visits grew longer until, one year, they did not return at all. Professor Lymere tearfully admitted that they had most likely perished, somewhere out in the desert.</p><p>But Ezreal could not accept that. They had been too careful in their preparations. They must still be out there, <i>somewhere</i>\u2026</p><p>Abandoning his reluctant studies, the budding explorer would strike out on his own. He knew, if he was ever to find his mother and father, he had to start with the final resting place of Ne\u2019Zuk. He spent weeks secretly gathering supplies from the university\u2014celestial diagrams, translations of runic sigils, guides on the burial rites of Shurima, and a pair of protective goggles. Leaving a note of farewell for his uncle, he snuck onto a supply ship bound for Nashramae.</p><p>Following his mother\u2019s meticulous field notes, he crossed the Great Sai with merchant caravans heading south. For many months, he delved into cavernous ruins beneath the shifting sands, relishing the freedom of the unknown, facing unspeakable horrors that guarded hidden chambers. With each step, Ezreal imagined himself following his parents\u2019 path, drawing ever closer to solving the mystery of their disappearance.</p><p>Finally, he managed what they evidently had not. Beneath the newer mausoleum of some unnamed emperor, he uncovered the tomb of Ne\u2019Zuk.</p><p>The great sarcophagus lay empty, save for a gleaming bronze gauntlet, with a bright, crystalline matrix at its center. As soon as Ezreal laid his hands upon it, the tomb itself seemed to turn upon him, with cunningly wrought traps and wards laid down thousands of years ago. With scarcely a thought, he donned the gauntlet and blasted his way through, even teleporting the last hundred yards back to the hidden entrance before the whole structure collapsed in a plume of sand and masonry dust.</p><p>Breathing hard, Ezreal looked down at the gauntlet as it hummed along with his heartbeat. He could feel it siphoning and amplifying his own essence. This, he realized, was a fearsome weapon of a previous age. A weapon fit for a god-warrior of Shurima, and the perfect tool for an explorer.</p><p>Soon after returning to Piltover, Ezreal found himself bounding from adventure to adventure. From lost cities to mystical temples, his nose for treasure-seeking led him to places most university professors could only read about on maps, and his reputation began to grow. Naturally, to Ezreal\u2019s mind, these tales rarely conveyed the true scope and scale of his exploits\u2026 but they did give him an idea. If he could make a name for himself as the greatest adventurer in the world, then his parents would surely return, and seek him out in person. </p><p>From the untamed borders of Noxus and Demacia, to the seedy depths of Zaun, and the frozen wilderness of the Freljord\u2014Ezreal chases fame and glory, uncovering long-lost artifacts and solving the riddles of history. While some may dispute the details of his anecdotes, or call his methods into question, he never answers his critics.</p><p>After all, they\u2019re clearly just jealous.<br></p>", "short": "<p>A dashing adventurer, unknowingly gifted in the magical arts, Ezreal raids long-lost catacombs, tangles with ancient curses, and overcomes seemingly impossible odds with ease. His courage and bravado knowing no bounds, he prefers to improvise his way out of any situation, relying partially on his wits, but mostly on his mystical Shuriman gauntlet, which he uses to unleash devastating arcane blasts. One thing is for sure\u2014whenever Ezreal is around, trouble isn\u2019t too far behind. Or ahead. Probably everywhere.</p>", "quote": "\u201cIf I don\u2019t know the rules, then how can I be breaking them?\u201d", "quote-author": ""}, "bioImage": null, "headerImage": null}, "related-champions": [{"type": "champion", "release-date": "2009-08-07", "name": "Kassadin", "slug": "kassadin", "echelon": 0, "associated-faction": "", "associated-faction-slug": "void", "image": {"type": "image", "title": {"en_us": ""}, "subtitle": "", "description": "", "uri": "https://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/img/champion/splash/Kassadin_0.jpg", "encoding": "image/jpeg", "width": 1215, "height": 717, "x": 973, "y": 108, "featured-champions": []}, "role": [{"name": "Assassin", "slug": "assassin"}, {"name": "Mage", "slug": "mage"}]}, {"type": "champion", "release-date": "2010-10-19", "name": "Lux", "slug": "lux", "echelon": 1, "associated-faction": "", "associated-faction-slug": "demacia", "image": {"type": "image", "title": {"en_us": ""}, "subtitle": "", "description": "", "uri": "https://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/img/champion/splash/Lux_0.jpg", "encoding": "image/jpeg", "width": 1215, "height": 717, "x": 784, "y": 51, "featured-champions": []}, "role": [{"name": "Mage", "slug": "mage"}, {"name": "Support", "slug": "support"}]}, {"type": "champion", "release-date": "2014-12-11", "name": "Rek'Sai", "slug": "reksai", "echelon": 2, "associated-faction": "", "associated-faction-slug": "void", "image": {"type": "image", "title": {"en_us": ""}, "subtitle": "", "description": "", "uri": "https://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/img/champion/splash/RekSai_0.jpg", "encoding": "image/jpeg", "width": 1215, "height": 717, "x": 728, "y": 193, "featured-champions": []}, "role": [{"name": "Fighter", "slug": "fighter"}]}], "explore-champions": [], "modules": [{"type": "story-preview", "title": "The Curator's Gambit", "subtitle": "by Matt Dunn", "description": "<p>Look, I should be clear\u2014I didn\u2019t want anything to do with \u201cthe dread lord,\u201d or whoever Januk was talking about.
