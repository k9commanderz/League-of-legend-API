As such, he was used to being bullied. In order to survive, he had to be scrappier and more resourceful than his peers. He developed a quick temper and a reputation for getting even, no matter who crossed him. This made him something of a loner, but he didn&apos;t mind. He liked to tinker, preferring the company of gadgets, and he could usually be found rummaging through the junkyard. </p><p>Rumble showed great potential as a mechanic, and his teachers recommended him for enrollment at the Yordle Academy of Science and Progress in Piltover. He may very well have become one of Heimerdinger&apos;s esteemed proteges, but Rumble refused to go. He believed that Heimerdinger and his associates were &apos;&apos;sellouts&apos;&apos; trading superior yordle technology to humans for nothing more than a pat on the head while yordles remained the butt of their jokes. </p><p>When a group of human graduates from the Yordle Academy sailed to Bandle City to visit the place where their mentor was born and raised, Rumble couldn&apos;t resist the temptation to see them face-to-face (so to speak). He only intended to get a good look at the humans, but four hours and several choice words later, he returned home bruised and bloodied with an earful about how he was an embarrassment to &apos;&apos;enlightened&apos;&apos; yordles like Heimerdinger. </p><p>The next morning, Rumble left Bandle City without a word, and wasn&apos;t seen again for months. When he returned, he was at the helm of a clanking, mechanized monstrosity. He marched it to the center of town amidst dumbfounded onlookers and there announced that he would show the world what yordle-tech was really capable of achieving.</p>", "short": "Rumble is a young inventor with a temper. Using nothing more than his own two hands and a heap of scrap, the feisty yordle constructed a colossal mech suit outfitted with an arsenal of electrified harpoons and incendiary rockets.
