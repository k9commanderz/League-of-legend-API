His pride swelled as the bodies piled ever higher behind him, and his intimidating presence kept countless warbands in line.</p><p>Even so, a single word was all it took to seal his fate. Sent to distant Zaun to eliminate a supposed conspiracy against the ruler of Noxus, Urgot realized too late the mission was a setup, removing him from the capital even as the usurper Swain seized control of it. Surrounded by agents of the chem-barons, and enraged that everything he believed was a lie, Urgot was dragged down into the chemtech mines beneath Zaun. He was defeated. He was <i>enslaved</i>. He was not worthy after all. He endured the mine\u2019s hellish conditions in grim silence, waiting for death.</p><p>In the Dredge, death came in many forms\u2026</p><p>The mine\u2019s warden, Baron Voss, would sometimes offer freedom in return for a prisoner\u2019s tortured confession\u2014granting it with the edge of her blade. From the screams that echoed through the tunnels, Urgot learned about the wonders of Zaun. There was something special about the city, something marvelous and evident even in the secrets that spilled from slit throats. Urgot didn\u2019t know what it was until he was finally brought before Voss, fearing that she would break him.</p><p>But as the baron\u2019s blade cut into his flesh, Urgot realized that his body was already wracked with agony, far beyond anything Voss could inflict. The Dredge had made him stronger than he\u2019d ever been as a headsman.</p><p><i>Pain</i> was Zaun\u2019s secret. His laughter drove Voss back to the surface, and a reign of anarchy began in the depths.</p><p>Seizing control of the prison, Urgot reveled in new trials of survival. He found the parts of his body that were weakest, and replaced them with scavenged machinery, technology created by those who would die without it\u2014necessity being the mother of pain.</p><p>The guards could no longer enter the areas Urgot had carved out of Voss\u2019 grasp. The prisoners themselves were more afraid of their new master than they were of her. Many even grew to hold a fanatical respect for Urgot, as they were forced to hear his feverish sermons on the nature of power, his grip tightening around the necks of those who would not listen.</p><p>Only when a Noxian agent arrived in the Dredge was Urgot finally forced to confront his own past. Though the spy recognized him and sought his aid in escaping, Urgot beat him mercilessly, and hurled his broken body into the darkness.</p><p>It was not strength that ruled Noxus, Urgot now realized, but men\u2026 and men were weak. There should be no rulers, no lies, nothing to interfere with the pure chaos of survival. Starting a riot that ignited a chemtech vein within the mine, Urgot shook the city above, and cracked the prison open in an explosion that rivaled the birth of Zaun itself. Many prisoners died, with thousands fleeing into the Sump\u2014but the worthy, as ever, survived.</p><p>From that day, Urgot\u2019s reign of terror only grew. A hideous fusion of industrial machinery and Noxian brutality, he slaughtered chem-barons and their lackeys one by one, gathering a following among Zaun\u2019s downtrodden masses. He was said to be a new savior, one who would lift the boot of the oppressor from the neck of every common Zaunite.</p><p>However, his actions did not make such distinctions, as Urgot tested the worthiness of the meek and the powerful alike. To any who found themselves spared in his deadly trials, his message was clear: he was not there to lead, but to <i>survive</i>. If others were worthy, they would survive, too.</p><p>When Urgot finally struck at representatives of the Piltovan merchant clans, the Wardens were forced to intervene, hauling him in chains to a fortified prison cell\u2014though this merely seemed to confirm \u201cthe Dreadnought\u201d as a legend among the gangers, the sump-snipes, and the forgotten.</p><p>For Piltover is not the first to shackle Urgot, and one must wonder if any cage can <i>ever</i> hope to hold him for long\u2026</p>", "short": "Once a powerful Noxian headsman, Urgot was betrayed by the empire for which he had killed so many. Bound in iron chains, he was forced to learn the true meaning of strength in the Dredge\u2014a prison mine deep beneath Zaun. Emerging in a disaster that spread chaos throughout the city, he now casts an imposing shadow over its criminal underworld. Raising his victims on the very chains that once enslaved him, he will purge his new home of the unworthy, making it a crucible of pain.", "quote": "\u201cThere is only one way to measure a man.
