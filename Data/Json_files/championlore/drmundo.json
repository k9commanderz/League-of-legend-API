This monosyllabic monstrosity seems to want nothing more than pain \u2013 both the giving of it, and the receiving of it. Wielding his massive meat cleaver as if it were weightless, Mundo is infamous for capturing and torturing dozens of Zaun\u2019s citizens for his nefarious \u201coperations,\u201d which seem to have no overall point or goal. He is brutal. He is unpredictable. He goes where he pleases. He is also not, technically, a doctor.</p><p>Stories differ as to the first sighting of Zaun\u2019s unpredictable purple madman. Some say they first saw him as a baby, crawling through the Piltover marketplace and terrifying the upper-class aristocrats with his foul smell. Others say he was born in Zaun and spent the first years of his life sloshing through the sewers and choking the life out of sumprats. Only one thing is for sure: when he was roughly three years old, he arrived on the doorstep of the Zaun Asylum for the Irreparably Troubled.</p><p>The other inmates of the asylum kept Mundo at a distance, but the asylum staff found the boy a source of constant fascination. They looked at him not as a child to be raised, but as a patient \u2013 a thing to be studied. Why was he purple? Who could have survived giving birth to someone of his size? </p><p>Within a year of his arrival, the doctors realized his skin was never going to change from its shockingly bright shade. When Mundo turned four, they discovered the extent of his unprecedented strength when he accidentally crushed an orderly\u2019s windpipe for not bringing him his favorite type of candy (toenails). When Mundo turned six, they discovered he had a relationship to pain that was... unusual. To say the least.</p><p>Specifically, Mundo didn\u2019t seem to mind pain. More than that, he actively sought it out. If left unsupervised, he\u2019d stick sharp instruments into his shoulders. If he was placed anywhere near other patients, it\u2019d only be a matter of minutes until one or both of them could be heard screaming in agony. </p><p>Soon the asylum staff tired of merely observing Mundo. It was time, they decided, to start experimenting. Whether they began their tests out of medical curiosity, a desire for scientific breakthrough, or sheer boredom is unknown. Whatever their reasons, the doctors unquestionably put a great deal of effort into understanding the purple enigma before them.</p><p>Over the next several years, they tested his tolerance for pain. They\u2019d stick needles into his fingernails, and he\u2019d giggle. They\u2019d put hot irons to his feet, and he\u2019d fall asleep. Soon, scientific curiosity gave way to outright frustration: they couldn\u2019t get Mundo to react negatively to pain at all, and they couldn\u2019t understand why. Not only that, but whatever damage they could do to him invariably healed itself within a few hours.</p><p>Throughout his teenage years, Mundo\u2019s life consisted of complete isolation and routine torture. </p><p>He\u2019d never been happier.</p><p>He came to see the doctors as aspirational figures. If pain was Mundo\u2019s passion, it was seemingly these doctors\u2019 life work: their myriad attempts to push beyond his pain threshold grew more unconventional as the years went on, including dipping his feet in acid and throwing flesh-eating mites on his face.</p><p>The asylum doctors were initially amused when the purple teen began to refer to himself not as \u201cMundo,\u201d but as \u201c<i>Doctor</i> Mundo.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d steal a syringe from an orderly and fill it with a mixture of cavernberry juice from breakfast and god-knows-what from his chamber pot. <i>\u201cMundo make medicine!\u201d</i> he\u2019d happily exclaim before jabbing the concoction into his own forehead.</p><p>In time, however, Mundo grew tired of experimenting on himself.</p><p>Later, many would speculate what Mundo\u2019s motivations were. Some assumed he was taking revenge for the years of torture he endured at the hands of the asylum staff. Others thought he was merely a psychopathic monster with no sense of morality.</p><p>The truth was much simpler: Mundo had decided it was time to put his research into practice.</p><p>One night, Mundo snuck into the kitchen. There, he found a massive meat cleaver. \u201cMedical\u201d blade in hand, Mundo proceeded to go from room to room, \u201coperating\u201d on every \u201cpatient\u201d he found with no logic to his method of \u201ctreatment\u201d other than what would amuse him the most at any given moment.</p><p>By daybreak, every single person in the asylum was \u201ccured,\u201d save for Mundo.</p><p>He donned a physician\u2019s coat from one of his victims, his massive muscles ripping it as he pulled it over his gargantuan frame. Mundo had realized his dream. He was a doctor! As a new member of a long and illustrious line, he had to share his medicinal skills with the rest of the world. His work had just begun. </p><p>He barged through the locked doors of the asylum and past the steps where he\u2019d been left so many years ago. Mundo walked into the streets of Zaun, a smile on his face and a spring in his step.</p><p>The doctor was in.</p>", "short": "Utterly insane, unrepentantly homicidal, and horrifyingly purple, Dr. Mundo is what keeps many of Zaun\u2019s citizens indoors on particularly dark nights.
