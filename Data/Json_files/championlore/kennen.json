Order, chaos, light, darkness -- all things must exist in perfect harmony for such is the way of the universe. This order is known as the Kinkou and it employs a triumvirate of shadow warriors to uphold its causes in the world. Kennen is one of these shadow warriors, entrusted with the sacred duty of Coursing the Sun - tirelessly conveying the justice of the Kinkou.</p><p>Kennen was born in Bandle City and it was said that in his first living moments he bolted first from the womb and second from the midwife who delivered him. His parents had thought that he would outgrow his boundless energy, but as he matured his energy found no limits and was matched only by his unnerving speed. Despite his astonishing gifts, he remained unnoticed (or at least uncaught, as he was quite the prankster) until, on a dare, he ran straight up the great outer wall of the Placidium. When word of this feat reached Kinkou ears, Kennen was quickly and quietly brought in for an audience. He found that the role of the Heart of the Tempest suited him, frenetically delivering both the word and the punishments of the Kinkou across the realm. He now works with his fellows Akali and Shen to enforce the balance of Valoran.</p>", "short": "More than just the lightning-quick enforcer of Ionian balance, Kennen is the only yordle member of the Kinkou. Despite his small, furry stature, he is eager to take on any threat with a whirling storm of shuriken and boundless enthusiasm. Alongside his master Shen, Kennen patrols the spirit realm, employing devastating electrical energy to strike down his enemies.", "quote": "''The Heart of the Tempest beats eternal...and those beaten remember eternally.''", "quote-author": ""}, "bioImage": null, "headerImage": null}, "related-champions": [{"type": "champion", "release-date": "2010-05-11", "name": "Akali", "slug": "akali", "echelon": 0, "associated-faction": "", "associated-faction-slug": "ionia", "image": {"type": "image", "title": {"en_us": ""}, "subtitle": "", "description": "", "uri": "https://universe-meeps.leagueoflegends.com/v1/assets/images/Classic_Akali_Splash.jpg", "encoding": "image/jpeg", "width": 1920, "height": 1080, "x": 939, "y": 162, "featured-champions": []}, "role": [{"name": "Assassin", "slug": "assassin"}]}, {"type": "champion", "release-date": "2010-03-24", "name": "Shen", "slug": "shen", "echelon": 1, "associated-faction": "", "associated-faction-slug": "ionia", "image": {"type": "image", "title": {"en_us": ""}, "subtitle": "", "description": "", "uri": "https://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/img/champion/splash/Shen_0.jpg", "encoding": "image/jpeg", "width": 1215, "height": 717, "x": 1034, "y": 0, "featured-champions": []}, "role": [{"name": "Tank", "slug": "tank"}, {"name": "Melee", "slug": "melee"}]}, {"type": "champion", "release-date": "2012-11-13", "name": "Zed", "slug": "zed", "echelon": 2, "associated-faction": "", "associated-faction-slug": "ionia", "image": {"type": "image", "title": {"en_us": ""}, "subtitle": "", "description": "", "uri": "https://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/img/champion/splash/Zed_0.jpg", "encoding": "image/jpeg", "width": 1215, "height": 717, "x": 925, "y": 22, "featured-champions": []}, "role": [{"name": "Assassin", "slug": "assassin"}, {"name": "Fighter", "slug": "fighter"}]}], "explore-champions": [], "modules": [{"section-title": "", "type": "image-gallery", "isFanArt": false, "fan-art-url": "", "featured-image": "", "title": "", "subtitle": "", "description": "", "assets": [{"type": "image", "title": {"cs_cz": "Grafick\u00fd n\u00e1vrh Kennena", "de_de": "Kennen \u2013 Konzeptzeichnung", "el_gr": "Concept art \u03b3\u03b9\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u039a\u03ad\u03bd\u03b5\u03bd", "en_au": "Kennen concept art", "en_gb": "Kennen concept art", "en_ph": "Kennen concept art", "en_pl": "Kennen concept art", "en_sg": "Kennen concept art", "en_us": "Kennen concept art", "es_ar": "Arte conceptual de Kennen", "es_es": "Arte conceptual de Kennen", "es_mx": "Arte conceptual de Kennen", "fr_fr": "\u00c9bauche conceptuelle de Kennen", "hu_hu": "Kennen koncepci\u00f3rajza", "id_id": "Konsep Art Kennen", "it_it": "Bozzetto di Kennen", "ja_jp": "\u30b1\u30cd\u30f3 \u30b3\u30f3\u30bb\u30d7\u30c8\u30a2\u30fc\u30c8", "ko_kr": "\ucf00\ub128 \ucee8\uc149 \uc544\ud2b8", "ms_my": "Konsep seni Kennen", "pl_pl": "Kennen \u2014 grafika koncepcyjna", "pt_br": "Arte conceitual de Kennen", "ro_ro": "Kennen \u2013 imagine conceptual\u0103", "ru_ru": "\u042d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0437 \u041a\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0430", "th_th": "\u0e20\u0e32\u0e1e\u0e04\u0e2d\u0e19\u0e40\u0e0b\u0e1b\u0e15\u0e4c\u0e02\u0e2d\u0e07 Kennen", "tr_tr": "Kennen konsept \u00e7al\u0131\u015fmas\u0131", "vn_vn": "H\u00ecnh m\u1eabu Kennen", "zh_cn": "\u51ef\u5357\u6982\u5ff5\u827a\u672f", "zh_tw": "\u51f1\u80fd \u6982\u5ff5\u85dd\u8853"}, "subtitle": "", "description": {}, "uri": "https://universe-meeps.leagueoflegends.com/v1/assets/images/image-gallery/kennen_yordle_ninja.jpg", "encoding": "image/jpeg", "width": 1216, "height": 998, "x": 816, "y": 383, "featured-champions": []}], "featured-champions": [{"type": "champion", "release-date": "2010-04-08", "name": "Kennen", "slug": "kennen", "echelon": 0, "associated-faction": "", "associated-faction-slug": "ionia", "image": {"type": "image", "title": {"en_us": ""}, "subtitle": "", "description": "", "uri": "https://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/img/champion/splash/Kennen_0.jpg", "encoding": "image/jpeg", "width": 1215, "height": 717, "x": 1018, "y": 37, "featured-champions": []}, "role": [{"name": "Mage", "slug": "mage"}, {"name": "Marksman", "slug": "marksman"}]}]}, {"type": "story-preview", "title": "The Bow, and the Kunai", "subtitle": "By Joey Yu", "description": "<p>The air of southern Shon-Xan was rife with raw magic.
