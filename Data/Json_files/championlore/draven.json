While supremely confident in his own ability\u2014some would say <i>overconfident</i>\u2014it is unlikely he would have survived childhood had it not been for his older brother, Darius, who invariably finished the fights Draven started.</p><p>When Basilich fell to the warhosts of Noxus, the brothers came to the attention of a captain named Cyrus, after Draven made an ill-considered attempt on his life. Impressed with their fighting spirit, Cyrus allowed them to join the Noxian ranks.</p><p>For years, the brothers fought as part of Cyrus\u2019 warhost\u2014yet while Darius took to this life easily, Draven grew steadily more bored. His martial skill was beyond question, but the daily drudgery of soldiering felt like too much effort for too little reward\u2026 and not enough personal glory.</p><p>Darius inevitably rose to command his own warband, and Draven joined him. However, if he thought that would be easier, or a way to achieve greater individual recognition, he was sorely disappointed.</p><p>Some say Draven chose to leave Darius\u2019 command. Some say he was forced out. Either way, his skills were highly sought after as a champion and duelist, and he was enticed to join a succession of warbands during the occupation of Ionia, before ending up with a fairly respectable contract in the Reckoning pits.</p><p>For centuries, the gladiatorial Reckoners had performed a vital role in Noxus\u2014punishing criminals and settling disputes between the noble houses\u2014and Draven was determined to receive the riches, adoration, and renown he felt he deserved. However, with long, protracted wars on many fronts, the spectacle was beginning to lose its appeal for the common citizen. As the attention of the crowds drifted, Draven fell into a slump, spending more and more time in the seedier drinking halls and gambling dens of the capital.</p><p>He was washed-up and broke when the former general Jericho Swain found him.</p><p>Swain had a plan to reclaim Noxus\u2019 lost glory, and needed Draven\u2019s help to achieve it. Perhaps Swain only enlisted him as a way to ensure his brother Darius\u2019 support after the fact. Regardless, Draven proved integral to Swain\u2019s plan\u2014to depose the Grand General himself, Boram Darkwill.</p><p>Standing triumphant with Swain, Draven smiled for the first time in months as the cheers of the Noxian people washed over him.</p><p>But duty called. In the days and weeks following this unprecedented coup, many among the noble elite refused to honor Swain\u2019s succession, so they were sentenced to death in the arena.</p><p>One condemned man escaped his handlers ahead of his execution. Operating on pure instinct\u2014as was ever his wont\u2014Draven leapt from the high balcony and hurled a pair of axes at the fleeing man, cutting him down in a heartbeat. After a moment of stunned silence, the crowd roared their approval. Draven retrieved his axes, spinning them high in the air, playing to his new fans, and savoring their rapturous applause.</p><p>Thus Draven became the Glorious Executioner, turning routine bouts into grand spectacles that drew ever larger crowds.</p><p>Soon enough, an enterprising (and diminutive) promoter, tired of paying to house, feed, and train Reckoners only for them to die in front of dwindling audiences, approached Draven with an idea. What if the drama of the classic pit fights could be combined with Draven\u2019s natural showmanship?</p><p>The Reckoners quickly became entertainers as much as combatants, each with their own carefully constructed backstory, fighting style, and flamboyant personality. The fights were often bloody\u2014this was still <i>Noxus</i> after all\u2014but far less often ended in death. The rivalries, trash-talking, and intrigue between the best-known Reckoners became the stuff of legend throughout the empire, but none were talked about more than Draven.</p><p>For a time he lived the high life, receiving invitations to a never-ending stream of parties and banquets, mixing with the wealthy and influential of Swain\u2019s new Noxus. He even reconciled with Darius, and would occasionally still march out with the warhosts, defeating enemy champions and generals in single combat.</p><p>Nevertheless, Draven has started to grow restless once again. He has all that he could have ever imagined, and more, but now dreams of the day when the whole <i>world</i> knows his name.</p>", "short": "In Noxus, warriors known as reckoners face one another in arenas where blood is spilled and strength tested\u2014but none has ever been as celebrated as Draven. A former soldier, he found that the crowds uniquely appreciated his flair for the dramatic, not to mention the spray of blood from each of his spinning axes. Addicted to the spectacle of his own brash perfection, Draven has sworn to defeat whomever he must to ensure that his name is chanted throughout the empire forever more.", "quote": "'' 'The best' is wherever I decide to set the bar each day.''", "quote-author": ""}, "bioImage": null, "headerImage": null}, "related-champions": [{"type": "champion", "release-date": "2012-05-23", "name": "Darius", "slug": "darius", "echelon": 0, "associated-faction": "", "associated-faction-slug": "noxus", "image": {"type": "image", "title": {"en_us": ""}, "subtitle": "", "description": "", "uri": "https://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/img/champion/splash/Darius_0.jpg", "encoding": "image/jpeg", "width": 1215, "height": 717, "x": 745, "y": 0, "featured-champions": []}, "role": [{"name": "Fighter", "slug": "fighter"}, {"name": "Tank", "slug": "tank"}]}, {"type": "champion", "release-date": "2010-10-05", "name": "Swain", "slug": "swain", "echelon": 1, "associated-faction": "", "associated-faction-slug": "noxus", "image": {"type": "image", "title": {"en_us": ""}, "subtitle": "", "description": "", "uri": "https://universe-meeps.leagueoflegends.com/v1/assets/images/swain-splash.jpg", "encoding": "image/jpeg", "width": 1920, "height": 1133, "x": 1458, "y": 0, "featured-champions": []}, "role": [{"name": "Mage", "slug": "mage"}, {"name": "Fighter", "slug": "fighter"}]}], "explore-champions": [], "modules": [{"slug": "new-dawn", "section-title": "Cinematic", "type": "featured-video", "featured-image": {"type": "image", "title": {"en_us": ""}, "subtitle": "", "description": "", "uri": "https://universe-meeps.leagueoflegends.com/v1/assets/images/featuredvideocover/new-dawn.jpg", "encoding": "image/jpeg", "width": 1920, "height": 1080, "x": 1229, "y": 350, "featured-champions": []}, "title": "A New Dawn", "subtitle": "", "description": "Day breaks over a landscape consecrated by blood and steel.
